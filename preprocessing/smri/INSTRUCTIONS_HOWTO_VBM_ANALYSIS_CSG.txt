INSTRUCTIONS - HOW TO DO VBM/CAT12 STRUCTURAL MRI ANALYSIS FOR SINGLE SUBJECT COMA PATIENTS FOR THE COMA SCIENCE GROUP, HOSPITAL OF LIEGE
==================================================================

1. use MRIConvert or dcm2niix to convert DICOMs (files acquired from MRI machine) to nifti files. This will create a subfolder with FLAWS INV2 in the folder name, and inside a .nii file.
2. Open MATLAB
3. type in MATLAB:
cd 'Z:\Research\CSG\Data\2-ANALYSES\MRI\vbm\pipeline\smri'
vbm_script_preproc_csg_relativepaths
4. select the FLAWS INV2 nifti file you just converted from the patient DICOMs. If there are multiple such folders, select the last one (most bottom one).
5. wait for the script to complete
6. at the end, the script will ask for a control's structural of same sex and similar age. You can find one out of the 40 control images in the folder 'Z:\Research\CSG\Data\2-ANALYSES\MRI\vbm\pipeline\CTR_40sbj_meanage45.2_structonly', each folder has a name including 'M' for male, 'F' for female, and a 2 digits number for the age (some controls are missing some info, simply don't use them).
7. open the patient's nifti folder (the one you created when you converted from DICOMs at step 1), and inside the 'mri' subfolder, find the image 'img_type1_final.png', this is the final results image.

Tip: to run analyses faster, you can copy the whole content of the 'Z:\Research\CSG\Data\2-ANALYSES\MRI\vbm\pipeline' folder onto your local hard disk (ie, on your computer), and run the script from there, without modifying anything, it should work fine (ie, it's using relative paths).

Tip2: check if the reorientation was correct by opening the FLAWS INV2 nifti file, for example with MRIcroN

Tip3: in the report subfolder (in the patient's nifti folder), you will find a pdf file with the GM/WM/CSF/WMH (lesions) volumes.

Tip4: you can visually see the segmentation of GM/WM/CSF and WMH (lesions) in subject's space, by opening in the mri subfolder the file rp0*rigid.nii, and then loading as colored overlays the files rp1*rigid.nii (GM), rp2*rigid.nii (WM), rp3*rigid.nii (CSF) and rp7*rigid.nii (WMH = lesions).
